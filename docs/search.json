    "text": "1 Introduction\nThis project investigates the annual changes and regional differences in basic service indicators such as improved water sources, improved sanitation facilities, adequate living space, and clean fuels, focusing on poorer countries. The analysis covers national and regional data and delves into categories based on criteria such as whether the country is a Least Developed Country (LDC) or a Landlocked Developing Country (LLDC). This topic was chosen because access to these services is an important measure of urban development and social equity, and a larger population with access to service improvements indicates a better balance between urban development and social equity. Understanding gaps and trends in service access can reveal how different cities and countries are improving the quality of life of their residents. Questions we want to explore include: which areas have the highest rates of access to different services? How do levels of access to different services vary over time?",

The database includes estimates from Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Malaria Indicators Survey (MIS). Standard estimation procedures were used across the data sources so that estimates may be compared both across countries and over time. The dataset is in xlsx format, containing 60 columns (e.g., Region Name, Country, LDC, year, Improved water sources, etc.) and 16675 rows. Each row represents the proportion of the population in a city with access to different basic services in a given year. The data updated yearly. We plan to use readxl package to import the data.\nData source: https://data.unhabitat.org/pages/access-to-basic-services-in-cities-and-urban-areas",

    "text": "The study found that most countries have seen significant improvements in the coverage of improved water sources and sanitation facilities from 1990 to 2023, with many non-LDCs approaching 100% coverage of improved water sources. However, the pace of basic service improvements in the least developed countries has been slower, particularly in landlocked countries and Southeast Asia, which still face severe infrastructure deficits. The prevalence of clean fuels has increased globally, but Asia’s high level of clean fuel prevalence is significantly lower than that of Africa, indicating regional imbalances in development. Limitations: During the research process, for regions with limited data and few statistical years, it was not possible to accurately capture the changes in basic service coverage. Future Research Directions: For incomplete data, adopt more effective methods to supplement the data, connect with datasets of other relevant factors, and further explore the causes of trend changes.Lessons Learned: When exploring the correlation between two variables and encountering outliers, additional variables can be introduced for grouping to identify the causes of the anomalies.",

However, there are some regions where even with high levels of improved water resources, access to basic drinking water services are still low, indicating that many people in these regions still do not have access to water within a short distance. And the overall level is not high.\nThis also shows that there is a relationship between access to drinking water and the level of development of the country, with the least developed countries having smaller access to drinking water.",

We find that those regions with low access to drinking water even though they have high improved water resources are located in South-eastern Asia.\nCentral Asia: Regions located in Central Asia have high levels of improved water and access to drinking water resources approaching 100%.\nSub-Saharan Africa: Access to drinking water resources and improved water resources are proportional in Sub-Saharan Africa, with the overall level slightly lower than in Central Asia, but also at a higher level.\nSouth-eastern Asia: The proportion of accessible drinking water resources is low in many regions and not proportional to the amount of improved water resource. This means that many South-eastern Asia regions not only need to increase the volume of improved water, but also work to increase access to the improved water resources that are already available.",

The proportion of improved piped water is greater than that of non-piped water every year. Even in 2011, when the proportion of non-piped water was the highest, it was still less than 50%.",

Most countries exhibit similar performance in Durable Structure and Sufficient Living Area, with non-least developed countries showing greater consistency between the two indicators. For example, Thailand and Uzbekistan have nearly overlapping values, demonstrating balanced performance.",

In contrast, Asia has a smaller proportion of low clean fuel accessibility, but regions with high clean fuel accessibility are almost nonexistent.\nOverall, low clean fuel accessibility prevails in Africa. Accelerating the development of clean fuel infrastructure is critical for least developed countries, particularly in Asia.",

The distribution is spread more in least-developed countries, with a significantly low coverage range and the highest peak below 25%.
