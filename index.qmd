# Introduction

Our objective focuses on visualizing the proportion of the population in cities with access to basic services (e.g., clean energy for lighting, improved sanitation facilities). This topic was chosen because access to these services is an important measure of urban development and social equity, and a larger population with access to service improvements indicates a better balance between urban development and social equity. Understanding gaps and trends in service access can reveal how different cities and countries are improving the quality of life of their residents. Questions we want to explore include: which areas have the highest rates of access to different services? How do levels of access to different services vary over time?
